Hi!

My name's Pablo (usually @pablorc online), and spanish software engineer. For many years I'd like to start a new development blog to talk about my own thoughts and doubts about development and software engineering.

I'm also trying to write in english to improve my language skills :). I'm sorry if you find any misprint. Drop me a line if you find any error. It would be very appreciated. Thanks!

Here you will find anything! Any framework, programming language, methodology,...

I'm awful creating this kind of posts about myself, so... Let's code!

{% highlight ruby %}
puts "Hello world!"
{% endhighlight %}
