Hi!

My name's Pablo (usually @pablorc online), and spanish developer. For many years I'd like to start a new development blog to talk about my own thoughts and doubts about development and software engineering.

I'm also trying to write in english to improve my langugage skills :). I'm very sorry if you find any misprint.

I'm awful creating this kind of posts about myself, so... Let's code!

{% highlight ruby %}
puts "Hello world!"
{% endhighlight %}
